# Why web-first?
App Store costs $99/year. GitHub Pages is free. Testing camera effects needs real iPhone. Web version validates the idea for $0 in 4 hours.

# Why Bayer dithering?
Ordered dithering (Bayer) is temporally stable = no flickering between frames. Floyd-Steinberg looks smoother but costs 5x CPU = 12fps instead of 60fps. The stippled pattern is part of the DOS aesthetic anyway.

# Why JavaScript for palette matching?
Metal shader would be 3x faster but requires Xcode + learning Swift. Current JS version hits 60fps at target resolution (320x200). Optimize when there's a performance problem, not before.

# Why these specific palettes?
VGA = authentic DOS aesthetic (primary goal)
CGA = 4-color runs 4x faster (only 4 distance calculations vs 16)
Amber/Green = monochrome terminal nostalgia (1-bit depth)
Grayscale = accessibility testing + universal appeal
```

**Step 5: Test with Claude Code**

In VS Code, open Claude Code and type:
```
Read .claudecode/instructions.md, then COMPONENTS.md, then TODO.md.

We're working on adding a dither strength slider control.

Confirm your understanding before proceeding.
```

**Expected response from Claude Code:**

It should read all three files and say something like:

"I understand we need to add a dither strength slider. From COMPONENTS.md I see the dithering algorithm is in dither.js. The slider will need to adjust the dither noise amplitude (currently hardcoded to 64 in the algorithm). I'll add a UI control in index.html and wire it to update the dithering strength in real-time. Should I proceed?"

**Step 6: Verify the system works**

After Claude Code completes the slider:
```
Session end checklist - update TODO.md, DECISIONS.md if you made any choices, and COMPONENTS.md if you created reusable code.
